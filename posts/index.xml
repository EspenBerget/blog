This is not an outrageous claim by any means as learning Java for instance will teach you OO and therefore you&amp;rsquo;ll know how to use OO in JavaScript.
That said. You do not need to learn Haskell to understand what map does in JS any more than you need C to know what a for loop does in JS.</description></item></channel></rss>
